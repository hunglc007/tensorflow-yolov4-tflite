## Counter Strike Global Offensive Aimbot using YOLOv4 object detection

**Disclaimer:** 
- The code is the fork of [hunglc007/yolov4](https://github.com/hunglc007/tensorflow-yolov4-tflite).
Some part of the code is refactored to my own needs and the project *will also be restructued* a bit as I learn the code.

- Also the dataset for CSGO is from [sainimohit23/yolov3-CSGO](https://github.com/sainimohit23/YOLOv3-Counter-Strike-Global-Offensive).
